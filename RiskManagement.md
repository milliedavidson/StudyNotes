# **Risk Management**

Should be a continuous process to assess and analyse risk. Each organisation decides what risk means to them and how much of it they will accept.

<br>
<br>

## **What is risk?**

**How much an entity is threatened by a situation that may or may not have happened yet.**

Risk is measured by:
- The *impact* if the situation happened
- How *likely* the situation is to happen

In cyber security, IT risk derives from business risk. How much cyber security is put in place depends on how much risk the organisation is willing to take. This risk is then *mitigated* to a point that is acceptable to the organisation.

**IMPACT** - how much harm can be expected. Impact doesn't always stop with the incident itself!

## **Assets, Vulnerabilities & Threats**

**ASSET** - something that is of value to the organisation and needs protecting

**VULNERABILITY** - a weakness or gap in this protection that could cause risk

**THREAT** - someone or something that might exploit the vulnerability 

Managing vulnerabilities requires knowing what they are first!!

Typical threats actors include:
- Cyber criminals
- Hacktivists
- Nation states
- Business competitors
- Intelligence gatherers
- Insiders 
- Opportunistic 
- AI & bots

## **Risk Identification**

Risks must be identified and their disruption potential analysed on an **ongoing basis**. 

- Communicate risk clearly
- Employees at *all* levels are responsible for identifying risk 
- Can't protect against risk if it's not identified!
