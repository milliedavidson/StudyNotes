# **Risk Management**

Should be a continuous process to assess and analyse risk. Each organisation decides what risk means to them and how much of it they will accept.

<br>
<br>

## **What is risk?**

**How much an entity is threatened by a situation that may or may not have happened yet.**

Risk is measured by:
- The *impact* if the situation happened
- How *likely* the situation is to happen

In cyber security, IT risk derives from business risk. How much cyber security is put in place depends on how much risk the organisation is willing to take. This risk is then *mitigated* to a point that is acceptable to the organisation.

**IMPACT** - how much harm can be expected. Impact doesn't always stop with the incident itself!

<br>
<br>

## **Assets, Vulnerabilities & Threats**

**ASSET** - something that is of value to the organisation and needs protecting

**VULNERABILITY** - a weakness or gap in this protection that could cause risk

**THREAT** - someone or something that might exploit the vulnerability 

Managing vulnerabilities requires knowing what they are first!!

Typical threats actors include:
- Cyber criminals
- Hacktivists
- Nation states
- Business competitors
- Intelligence gatherers
- Insiders 
- Opportunists
- AI & bots

## **Risk Identification**

Risks must be identified and their disruption potential analysed on an **ongoing basis**. 

- Communicate risk clearly
- Employees at *all* levels are responsible for identifying risk 
- Can't protect against risk if it's not identified!

Isolated, one-off incidents are often the place to start looking!

<br>
<br>

## **Risk Assessment**

Risk assessment consists of identifying risks, estimating their potential impact and prioritising risks.

e.g. the risk of fire to a building:
- **Fire alarms** will alert people to leave
- They are low cost 
- They reduce the risk of injury
- But they won't *stop* the fire!

<br>

- **Sprinkler systems** won't alert to a fire
- But they can minimise the damage
- Unless they're in a data centre...
- In which case they will likely destroy all the data systems!!
- A gas solution would work for a data centre
- But can be very costly 

A risk assessment determines the best solution for the organisation and the assets they are protecting. This is documented and approved by management.
