# **Risk Management**

It should be a continuous process to assess and analyse risk. Each organisation decides what risk means to them and how much of it they will accept.

## **What is Risk? ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**How much an entity is threatened by a situation that may or may not have happened yet.**

<br>

Risk is measured by:
- The *impact* if the situation happened
- How *likely* the situation is to happen

In cyber security, IT risk derives from business risk. How much cyber security is put in place depends on how much risk the organisation is willing to take. This risk is then *mitigated* to a point that is acceptable to the organisation.

**IMPACT** - how much harm can be expected. Impact doesn't always stop with the incident itself!

<br>
<br>

## **Assets, Vulnerabilities & Threats**

**ASSET** - something that is of value to the organisation and needs protecting

**VULNERABILITY** - a weakness or gap in this protection that could cause risk

**THREAT** - someone or something that might exploit the vulnerability 

Managing vulnerabilities requires knowing what they are first!!

Typical threats actors include:
- Cyber criminals
- Hacktivists
- Nation states
- Business competitors
- Intelligence gatherers
- Insiders 
- Opportunists
- AI & bots

## **Risk Identification**

Risks must be identified and their disruption potential analysed on an **ongoing basis**. 

- Communicate risk clearly
- Employees at *all* levels are responsible for identifying risk 
- Can't protect against risk if it's not identified!

Isolated, one-off incidents are often the place to start looking!

An example risk is training new staff - it's time-consuming, a costly investment and represents an increased cyber risk to the organisation! 

Once risks are identified, prioritise and anaylse them. Use **qualitative** and/or **quantative** risk analysis.

**QUALITATIVE** - risk is assigned a descriptor, such as low, medium and high.

**QUANTATIVE** - risk impact and likelihood are assigned numerical values. 

Understanding what the organisation aims to achieve and what processes they need to achieve that will help identify risk. 

A risk matrix is handy for prioritising risk:

### **Risk Matrix**

![A risk matrix - a vertical arrow on the left is labelled 'probability'. A horizontal arrow is along the bottom and labelled 'impact'. There is a grid of 4 risk possibilities: bottom left says low probability, low impact. Bottom right says low probability, high impact. Upper left says high probability, low impact. Upper right says high probability, high impact.](Screenshots/Low%20impact.png)

## **Risk Assessment**

Risk assessment consists of identifying risks, estimating their potential impact and prioritising risks.

e.g. the risk of fire to a building:
- **Fire alarms** will alert people to leave
- They are low cost 
- They reduce the risk of injury
- But they won't *stop* the fire!

<br>

- **Sprinkler systems** won't alert to a fire
- But they can minimise the damage
- Unless they're in a data centre...
- In which case they will likely destroy all the data systems!!
- A gas solution would work for a data centre
- But can be very costly 

A risk assessment determines the best solution for the organisation and the assets they are protecting. This is documented and approved by management. 

<br>
<br>

## **Risk Treatment**

Deciding what the best actions are to take to mitigate the risk. What to take into account:

- **Avoidance** 

- **Acceptance**

- **Mitigation**

- **Transfer**

<br>

**Risk avoidance:** Avoid/eliminate the risk completely! This is often the case when the risk will have such a high impact that it's better to entirely shut down the operation.

**Risk acceptance:** Take no action to reduce the risk and just accept it; carry on with the risky activity. This often happens because the impact would be negligible. 

**Risk mitigation:** Prevent or reduce the possibility of the risk and its impact. Most common way to manage risk. Mitigation can include security controls and new policies/procedures/standards.

**Risk transference:** Transferring the risk to another party i.e. an insurance company. They will deal with any financial impact, not the organisation.
