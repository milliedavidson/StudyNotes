# **Study Notes ðŸ“š**

## **Overview**

This repository is a collection of notes from everything I've been learning recently. It's intended to be a backup of my notes, as well as a portfolio to demonstrate my knowledge level and commitment to always improving my skills.

It's all written in my own words and I've been very careful not to plagiarise from the sources I've been learning from. Be aware: it's in note format, so passages will sometimes read as janky streams of thought (because they are)! 

The notes are often accompanied by screenshots of me putting into practice what I've learnt, troubleshooting any issues I've run into along the way and how I've solved them (with acknowledgments to the wonderful helpers of the internet).

I review the notes in line with the super helpful [SM-2 spaced repetition schedule](https://www.lifehack.org/851026/spaced-repetition) - highly recommended! As I review notes, I'll correct any spelling/grammar errors and revise bits of information as my knowledge progresses.

## **How to use this project**

Hopefully you can use this as inspiration to create your own study note portfolio (it's a brilliant learning tool). Or perhaps to be convinced that I'm diligent and determined enough to make an excellent addition to your project :)
