### **Physical Controls**

Implemented through some tangible mechanism e.g.:

- Fences
- Doors
- Walls
- Locks
- Bollards
- Guards

They often control or prevent movement in the organisation's location, like when entering the building through a dedicated door, so their entry can be permitted and recorded.  

Often, these physical controls are incorporated with [technical controls](#technicallogical-controls), such as a badge reader connected to a door lock.

### **Technical/Logical Controls**
Computer systems/networks implement these controls directly. They include:

- Settings stored as data
- Settings in hardware (e.g. switches)
- Managed through a software GUI
