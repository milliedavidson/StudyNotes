## **Agile Methodologies**

Agile is not any particular tool or practice. Thereâ€™s no single flavour of agile, but there are many methodologies (like Scrum, Kanban & Lean). You can use a mix of approaches; SCRUM is the most popular one. They all focus on producing working prototypes. 

Apps are always developed in an agile way - the dev team get feedback on bugs, new features etc. They come up with an updated product idea, implement the code and the update gets released. This process cycles round constantly, with the user getting regular updates. 

<br>
<br>

## **Waterfall Method** ðŸŒŠ

The waterfall method is what **NOT** to do. Itâ€™s too linear with too much upfront analysis - e.g. the design gets done but is never revisited. There is no opportunity to realise thereâ€™s a problem and fix it. The waterfall approach may work for small systems, but will turn out badly on a big project.

<br>
<br>

## **Agile Manifesto**
### *-> agilemanifesto.org*

The agile manifesto is a collaboration by software developers, who took successful ideas and wrote a set of underlying values and principles. 

**Individuals & interactions** over processes and tools

- **Working Software** over comprehensive documentation

- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

- **Responding to change** over following a plan

The bold part is where you place the **emphasis** - itâ€™s not to say the small print isnâ€™t important, itâ€™s just less so.

<br>

### **Individuals & interactions over processes and tools:**

Agile focuses more on communication rather than the development processes. Good communication = better collaboration. This helps maintain a smooth process and produces efficient and higher-quality results. A plan is important, but it has to be flexible because things change and we need to respond to that.

<br>

### **Working Software over comprehensive documentation:**

Agile measures progress through working software. This allows for accurate measurements of progress that have been completed through the project. One way to track progress is through task boards.

<br>

### **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:**

Collaboration is more important than a fixed contract. There should be collaboration throughout the process. Check the client is happy with the requirements, make changes and come back for feedback. It will create a better product, rather than disappearing for the contract duration and coming back with something the client may not like.

<br>

### **Responding to change over following a plan:**

With agile, you can change the plan if new things arise - such as if the market for your product has changed during the duration of your plan. The waterfall method never responds to change.

<br>
<br>

## **The 12 Agile Principles**
### *-> http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html*

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organising teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.

## **3 Pillars of Scrum**

**TRANSPARENCY** - Everyone presents the facts as they are and collectively collaborates for the common organisational objective. No one has a hidden agenda.

<br>

**INSPECTION** - Not done by an inspector but by everyone on the scrum team. The inspection can be done for the product, processes, people, aspects and practices. Look out for things like people not pulling their weight and check the requirements are being met. 

<br>

**ADAPTATION** - Adaptation is about continuous improvement; adapting based on the results of the inspection. Everyone should reflect on how to improve.

<br>
<br>

## **The Scrum Team**

The scrum team should be tightly integrated, engaged with the customers and **self-organising**. They are accountable and empowered - everyone is responsible for the collective success of the project. 

The team should be **cross-functional**. All the necessary skills and experience required for the project lie within the team and no one outside of the team is relied on to complete work items. Each team member may not have all the skills needed to build the project, but is competent in their area of expertise. 

<br>
<br>

## **Scrum Roles**

**PRODUCT OWNER** - The person defining the parameters for the project and who gives the product requirements. They have a deep understanding of the product and communicate with stakeholders outside the scrum team. The Product Owner is the customerâ€™s voice - it's their responsibility to measure the project's performance and see if the team are on track to complete it on time. Ultimately, they are responsible for the final product.

<br>

**SCRUM MASTER** - The Scrum Master is responsible for maintaining scrum values and ensuring the scrum team is operating as effectively as possible. They are actively involved; keeping track of how everyone is getting on and removing any blockers. They also facilitate meetings and consult the Development Team and Product Owner. Theyâ€™re a specialist in running scrum projects, rather than in the product itself. 

<br>

**DEVELOPMENT TEAM** - An effective development team is around 3-9 people. They are self-organising and decide on the items for the upcoming sprint, develop the sprint backlog items and complete the sprint tasks. They take part in the retrospective too. 

<br>
<br>

## **Scrum Ceremonies**

All the four ceremonies in scrum are opportunities for inspection and apadation.

- Sprint planning
- Daily scrum
- Sprint review
- Sprint retrospective

The power to cancel the sprint lies only with the Product Owner - e.g. in the case items are no longer required by the business. 

When in the sprint planning meeting, developers are free to make changes to the sprint backlog items. They can remove items which they think canâ€™t be completed with the current teamâ€™s capacity. Addition or removal should always be done in consensus with the Product Owner, as they decide on the priority of items. 

Removal of sprint items is not allowed once the sprint has started. The sprint is timeboxed and cannot be extended or shortened - it ends on the date agreed. Any uncompleted sprints are moved back to the product backlog and the priority is revised. 

If the sprint item is completed before time, the development team can start on new sprints from the product backlog. Completed items are demonstrated in the sprint review meeting. 

<br>

### Sprint Review

The sprint review is there to inspect and seek feedback from the stakeholder and adapt accordingly (introspect & adapt). The project's performance is demonstrated to the stakeholders and customers by the Product Owner. The development team demonstrate the increment. The stakeholders and customers provide feedback, which is then incorporated by the team.

<br>

### Daily Scrum 

The development team are required to attend the daily scrum (also known as daily standup) every day. The Scrum Master can attend and facilitate the meeting if requested. Anyone else who wishes to attend is welcome, including stakeholders, though they are not allowed to participate or give updates. 

<br>

### Requirements

Requirements are what the project should achieve and what you want the project to do. What does the client want their product to do?

**Functional requirements** - e.g. Spotify needs to play music

**Non-functional requirements** - e.g. Spotify wants to look aesthetic 

Have a meeting at the beginning of the project between the Product Owner and scrum team. Gather the requirements from the Product Owner, make notes and add input. Make sure the requirements are noted in a standardised format like **user stories**. 

<br>

## **User Stories & Epics**

Different users will have different requirements. A high-level requirement might be to listen to any music they want, but this needs to be broken down into manageable chunks; we call these user stories. 

A big user story is called an **EPIC** and is made up of several user stories. Sometimes an epic isnâ€™t even needed, because if all the user stories are complete, the epic is too. 

User stories are created by the scrum team. They don't include all the detail - theyâ€™re just pointers to the real requirement. You want the info condensed to one sentence and it should be understandable by anyone.

The standard structure for a user story is INVEST:

- Independent
- Negotiate
- Valuable
- Estimable
- Small
- Testable

As a *--type of user--* I want *--goal--* so that *--reason--*

As a *--spotify listener--* I want *--to be able to select a track--* so that *--I can listen to the music Iâ€™m interested in--*

Examples: 
- I need a registration form to access the system

- I need a login form so I can enter my credentials

- I need a link to reset my password so I can access the system if I forget my credentials

Create collaboratively, keep stories simple, refine stories until they are ready and satisfy INVEST. 

<br>
<br>

## **Product Backlog**

The product backlog is the whole list of user stories. The **Product Owner is responsible** for this. It contains lists of new features, bug fixes, tasks and work requirements needed to build the requested product. Itâ€™s usually compiled from various input sources, such as customer support and market analysis.

Product backlog refinement is a meeting where the whole team gets together and brainstorms around the backlog items. It is not a timeboxed event, but a **continuous process **that can be conducted whenever the team wants. The items are refined - details are added and items are ordered based on their priority. Once refined, the development team members estimate the product backlog items. 

<br>
<br>

## **Sprint Backlog**

The sprint backlog is a set of tasks from the product backlog that are chosen to be developed during the next sprint. This artefact is planned by the development team. It gets updated during the sprint planning phase of the scrum.

<br>

**PRODUCT INCREMENT** - Tasks that were completed during the previous and current sprint. Itâ€™s categorised in increments, with one increment per sprint. This is useful for version control and logging changes done for the product. 

<br>

**ESTIMATION & PRIORITISING** - This is done through planning poker - a blank card is issued to each team member where they write their estimate. The team then discuss the estimate of completing a task before revealing the cards. If there are big differences in the values revealed, the team discuss why. 

<br>

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

Agreed conditions that allow us to establish when the user story has been completed.

<br>

**User story:**

Bob, the interested customer, wants to register for a YouTube account so he can save videos for later viewing.

<br>

**Acceptance criteria:**

Need to collect the email address and password

A confirmation email should be sent to the user

When the user clicks a link in the email, they should be sent a success page

Registrations that have been confirmed should be stored still

<br>

**Definition of Ready** - The requirements that must be met in order for a story to move from backlog to development. No point in starting development until these are completed. 

<br>

**Definition of Done** - A checklist created by the scrum team to create a shared understanding of what is required to make a product releasable. This increases transparency. The list must be completed before declaring development finished. 	

<br>

**Gherkin Syntax** -> (the structure of acceptance criteria) ðŸ¥’

- **GIVEN** - the prerequisites

- **WHEN** - the event to provoke the output

- **THEN** - the output of the event

Example scenario - user wants to see lessons on website:

GIVEN - user is on the home page

WHEN - the user clicks the booking page

THEN - the user sees the lessons available 

<br>
<br>

## **Task Management**

Scrum-specific task management is done with boards, such as wireframes. For example, a customer wants a website. Youâ€™d create a wireframe of what the website will look like (a drawing). If the customer says yes, you start coding and creating the real pages. If not, go back and make a new wireframe.

<br>
<br>

## **Retrospective**

The sprint retrospective is performed at the end of every sprint. Itâ€™s a meeting where all the team members sit and retrospect on their current sprint and lay out the action items to improve for the upcoming events. In scrum, itâ€™s mandatory to conduct all scrum ceremonies, including this. 

There are several metrics used in scrum to project the completion date of the project, assuming the product backlog, teamâ€™s capacity and team velocity remains the same. 

**THE AGENDA** - Set the stage, gather data, generate insights, decide what to do, and close the retrospective.

**STARFISH METHOD** - More of, less of, keep doing, start doing and stop doing.

**TEAM BOARD** - What went well and what could be improved.

**BURNDOWN CHART** - Represents the amount of remaining work with respect to the time. The horizontal axis represents time, whereas the vertical axis is the amount of work remaining.

**MOOD GRAPH** - There is a happy, in the middle and low section on the graph and each team member puts a line according to how they are feeling. A great tool to generate insight.

<br>
<br>

## **The Prime Directive**

The prime directive is meant to instil a **positive mindset**, reassuring the group that the retrospective will be conducted openly, with trust, no judgement and without apportioning blame. Itâ€™s about being empathic. If there is a clash in the team, donâ€™t wait until the retrospective to resolve the situation. 

Regardless of what we discover, we understand and believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their abilities, the resources available and the situation at hand.
