Security Assurance - umbrella term for these processes:

Security hardening 
Security testing
Vulnerability management

Security hardening - minimising a system’s attack surface, properly configuring security functions. You can do this by:
    - Disabling unnecessary components
    - Removing system accounts not needed
    - Closing communications that you don’t need open 
    - Proper configuration of firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention 
Harden your system BEFORE it’s deployed and regularly verify its security after. 

Security Testing - make sure the system really is secure by testing it and finding weaknesses or vulnerabilites. Includes:
- Automated vulnerability scans
- OWASP Top 10 is a good pointer for what to test for
- Manual testing, like source code vulnerabilities 
- Scan regularly!

Vulnerbaility management - takes results of security tests and mitigates them (i.e. lessen their potential damage).
- Analyse findings (is it actually an issue?)
- How big of a priority?
- Mitigation (how to fix it)

A system can never be 100% secure - just aim to avoid the critical and easy to exploit vulnerabilities!
